CleverCook is our vision to bring great recipes to anyone. We want to be able to provide brand new cooks with great recipes they can confidently cook. We want diet restricted people to have an easy way to exclude what they need to. We want the professional level cooks to have a place they can search for inspiration from other highly skilled individuals.

### User Reaserch
Based on previous user research and feedback from lo-fi prototype testing, itâ€™s evident that users face various cooking-related challenges, from ingredient availability and remembering recipes to efficiently selecting and browsing through them. Users from diverse backgrounds, including college seniors and full-time employees, unanimously seek solutions that elevate their cooking experience. 

Lo-fi prototype testing yielded positive feedback, indicating that the prototypes were intuitive and easy to navigate. Users found buttons and interactive elements like dropdown menus easy to use and understand. The process of posting a recipe, for example, was straightforward for users, with clear prompts and an intuitive interface guiding them through the task. This feedback confirmed the prototypes' design effectiveness and user-friendly approach.

One valuable piece of feedback suggested the inclusion of recipe preparation time, highlighting the importance of this information for users planning their cooking. Consequently, our team decided to integrate this feature into the final solution, along with combining the strengths of both prototype concepts to enhance user experience.

The Medium-Fi Interactive Prototype aims to address all identified user challenges. The Medium-Fi Prototype incorporates all the feedback we have received since the start of this process. This user-centered approach, driven by direct feedback and careful consideration of user experiences, will ensure that our final product genuinely enhances the cooking experience for a diverse user base.
